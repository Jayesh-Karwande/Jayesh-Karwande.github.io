<p>Hi...!I am Jayesh Karwande Alumni of Class of 2021 at of Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology,Delhi.I belong from Auranagabd which is the only tourist district of India having two-world heritage monuments to its credit.I like uncertainities,numbers,predications and classifications,as a result of this my areas of interest are stochastic modelling,probability and machine learning.I belive that each person in the world is independent random variable and can be easily correlated with principle of stochastic procesess.</p>

<p> Currently I am enjoying learning as a Data Scientist at Micron Techology, where I develop machine learning algorithms for optimization of various semicondictor procesess.During my college days I was assigned as Secretary of National Service Scheme Chapter of <a href="http://nss.iitd.ac.in/#!/">IIT Delhi</a>, where I lead the Innovation Domain and is founder of a project named Know Your Rights which aims to aware people about various government policies.I was part of Alumni relations and international collaborations team of <a href="https://edc.iitd.ac.in/">Entrepreneurship Development Cell, IIT Delhi</a>.I have recieved Design Innovation Summer Award from <b>Design Innovation Cell of Ministry of Human Resorce Developemet</b>(Now Shksha Mantralay) for developing a proof of concept prototype to field deployable functional prototypes.Adding to this I was selected for Indian National Acdemy of Engineer's Youth Conlave.I have enlisted few projects of mine.</p>

<p>Apart fromm academics I love fottball,I admire Barelona and Lionel Messi,you can find some of my blogs regarding footabll on this page.Also I like to dance,I had participated in Group Dance Competition of IIT Delhi.I can speak four languages which are Marathi,Hindi,English,Spanish and Punjabi.I love maharshtrian food,marathi novel and with special mention,Pu.La.Deshpande.I make memes as well.</p>

<li><b><u>Stabilization of NCS as Switching Systems with Packet Losses by Reduced Norm Feedback Control</u></b></li>
<ol>
<li> Modelled NCS as switched systems and derived asymptotic stability conditions by finding appropriate feedback matrix.</li>
<li> Out of many possible solutions, singled out the feedback matrix of minimal norm.</li>
<li> Restricted the closed loop poles inside the unit circle, with keeping the option of adjusting the constraint open as per requirement.</li> 
<li> Derived suggested method of transmission i.e the number of data packet transmission periods suitable for transmission with the condition to sustain data packet losses upto (d-1).</li>
