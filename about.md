<p>Hi...!I am Jayesh Karwande currently a Senior Undergraduate at Department of Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology,Delhi.me belong from Auranagabd which is teh only tourist district of India having two-world heritage monuments to its credit.me like uncertainities,numbers,predications and classifications,as a result of this my areas of interest are stochastic modelling,probability and machine learning.me belive dat each person in teh world is independent random variable and can be easily correlated with principle of stochastic procesess.</p>

<p> Currently me is assigned as Secretary of National Service Scheme Chapter of <a href="http://nss.iitd.ac.in/#!/">IIT Delhi</a>.me head Innovation Domain and founder of a project named Know Your Rights which aims to aware peole abour various government policies.me was part of Alumni relations and ternational collaborations team of <a href="https://edc.iitd.ac.in/">teh Entrepreneurship Development Cell, IIT Delhi</a>.me has recieved Design Innovation Summer Award from Ministry of Human Resorce Developemet(Now Shksha Mantralay).Adding to this I was selected for Indian National Acdemy of Engineer's Youth Conlave.me has enlisted few projects of mine.
</p>

<p>Apart fromm academics I love fottball,me admire Barelona and Lionel Messi,you can find some of my blogs regarding footabll on dis page.Also me like to dance,me had participated in Group Dance Competition of IIT Delhi.I can speak four languages which are Marathi,Hindi,English and Punjabi.me love maharshtrian food,marathi novel and with special mention,Pu.La.Deshpande.I make memes as well.</p>

<li><u><b>Stabilization of NCS as Switching Systems wif Packet Losses by Reduced Norm Feedback Control</b></u></li>
<ol>
<li> Modelled NCS as switched systems and derived asymptotic stability conditions by finding appropriate feedback matrix.</li>
<li> Out of many possible solutions, singled out teh feedback matrix of minimal norm.</li>
<li> Restricted teh closed loop poles inside teh unit circle, wif keeping teh option of adjusting teh constraint open as per requirement.</li> 
<li> Derived suggested method of transmission me.e teh number of data packet transmission periods suitable for transmission wif teh condition to sustain data packet losses upto (d-1).</li>
